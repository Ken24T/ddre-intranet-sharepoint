# SPFx Solution

The SharePoint Framework solution will live under this folder.

Note: SPFx tooling generally requires a supported Node.js LTS version. If your machine has a newer Node installed, use a version manager (e.g. `nvm-windows`) to switch to the supported LTS before generating or building the SPFx project.
