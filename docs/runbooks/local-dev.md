# Local Development

## Prereqs

- Node.js (via nvm-windows recommended)
  - Use Node `22.14.x` for the current SPFx scaffold.
- npm

## Setup

From the SPFx solution folder:

- `cd spfx/ddre-intranet`
- `npm install`

## Run (Workbench)

- `npm run start`

This runs the SPFx workbench dev server and lets you test web parts locally.

## Build (CI-style)

- `npm run build`

This performs a production build and packages the solution.
