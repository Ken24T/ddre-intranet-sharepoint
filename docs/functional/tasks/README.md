## Notifications and reminders

Tasks integrate with the notification system in two ways: the notifications bell and the Status Bar.

### Notifications bell (navbar)
1. Select the **Notifications** bell icon.
2. Review grouped items (Overdue, Due today).
3. Select **Mark all as read** to clear unread badges.
4. Select **View All Tasks** to open the Tasks panel.

> [!suggestion] What you should see
> - A flyout grouped by category with due date context (e.g., “Due today”, “2 days overdue”).
> - Unread items display a dot until marked read.

### Status Bar task banner
When you have overdue or due‑today tasks, the Status Bar shows a banner.

1. Hover to see a tooltip summary.
2. Select the banner to open Tasks.
3. Select **Dismiss** to hide the banner for now (and mark banner items as read).

> [!suggestion] What you should see
> - A banner message like **“You have 2 overdue and 1 due today task”**.
> - A tooltip listing the top tasks with due‑date hints.

### Notification settings on a task
Each task includes notification controls in the editor:
- **Do not notify me about this task** toggle.
- **Email reminder** dropdown (disabled if notifications are turned off).

> [!suggestion] Hint
> - Turning on **Do not notify** disables email reminder selection.
> - Email reminder options include common offsets (e.g., 1 hour before, 1 day before).

## Troubleshooting

- **I can’t find a task:** Clear filters and switch to **All**.
- **No notifications are showing:** Ensure the task has a due date and notifications are enabled.
- **Email reminder is disabled:** Turn off **Do not notify me about this task**.

## Tips

- Use **Pending** to stay on top of active work.
- Use **Overdue** to triage urgent items quickly.
- Add a checklist for multi‑step work to visualise progress.
