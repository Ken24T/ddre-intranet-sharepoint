# Docs

This folder contains the project’s non-code assets: decisions, governance, runbooks, and integration notes.

Suggested starting points:

- `architecture/` – architectural decisions and diagrams
- `governance/` – access model, group naming, and permission guidance
- `integrations/` – API/proxy contracts and vendor handover notes
- `runbooks/` – developer workflows (release/tagging/deploy)
